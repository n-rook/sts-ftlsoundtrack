  "description": "A mod which replaces Slay the Spire\u0027s soundtrack with the soundtrack from FTL.\n\nSlay the Spire has great music, but after a few hundred hours you might want to change things up. This mod replaces the music with the soundtrack from the game FTL: Faster Than Light, composed by Ben Prunty! Enjoy FTL\u0027s dynamic soundtrack, as different arrangements of the same song play depending on if your character is in combat.\n\nThis mod requires the FTL soundtrack be purchased separately. If you\u0027ve purchased and downloaded the soundtrack DLC for FTL, it should be loaded automatically; otherwise, you will have to go into the mod settings and tell it where the files can be found. Only MP3 files are supported. I only recently released this mod, so PLEASE let me know on GitHub or here if you run into any problems!\n\nThis mod is not endorsed by Ben Prunty or Subset Games.\n",
