# FTL Soundtrack

This mod plays the soundtrack composed by Ben Prunty for the game FTL inside Slay the Spire.

Currently, you need to own the "FTL Soundtrack" DLC for FTL on Steam for it to work.
I plan to add options that let you find the FTL Soundtrack in your music library as well,
if you bought it on [Bandcamp](https://benprunty.bandcamp.com/album/ftl) or elsewhere.

Most importantly, the dynamic soundtrack works: the battle themes will fade in when you're in
combat, and will fade out during peacetime.
