# FTL Soundtrack

This mod plays the soundtrack composed by Ben Prunty for the game FTL inside Slay the Spire.

This mod does not include the FTL soundtrack.

Note that buying FTL won't give you the soundtrack; you need to buy it
separately. Steam offers it as DLC. In addition, you can buy it on
[Bandcamp](https://benprunty.bandcamp.com/album/ftl).

The mod will scan for the soundtrack in the FTL directory in your Steam Library
if you have it installed, but otherwise you'll have to scan for it
manually. Please let me know if you have any problems getting the soundtrack
recognized.
